Features Setup Usage Troubleshooting Acknowledgments Features

Automated Search: Searches Buyee for specified terms and keywords. Filtered Results: Matches listings based on user-provided keywords. File Output: Saves the URLs of matched listings to matches.txt. Simple GUI: Provides a user-friendly interface to start a search and view results. Setup

Prerequisites Python: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Chrome: Install Google Chrome. ChromeDriver: Download and place the correct version of ChromeDriver in your system PATH or project folder. Installation Clone this repository to your local machine: bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/jdeandrade22/BuyeeBot1.git cd BuyeeBot Install the required Python packages: bash Copy code pip install -r requirements.txt Update the main.py file with the path to your ChromeDriver if it isnâ€™t in your system PATH. Usage

Run the Bot: Launch the main script to open the GUI: bash Copy code python main.py Enter Search Criteria: Enter the search term in the input field (e.g., "work xt7") and click Search. Results Display: Once the search completes, the bot will display the number of matching listings in the results box. The links to matched listings will be saved to matches.txt. Troubleshooting

Timeout Errors: If the bot encounters a TimeoutException, make sure the ChromeDriver matches your Chrome version. Tcl RuntimeError: PySimpleGUI and Tkinter require single-threaded GUI updates. The bot uses a queue system to handle threading, but if errors persist, restart the bot and ensure Python is using the main thread for GUI updates. Empty Results: If no links are saved, verify the keywords used are appropriate for the desired listings on Buyee. Acknowledgments
